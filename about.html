  <h2>About Our Company</h2>

  <p>Our company is all about helping you save tons of money on your trip to Europe and make sure you have a good time in the process. While our method isn't for everyone, it certainly can help and allow you to go to Europe for an unbelieveable price.</p>

  <h2>About Our Staff</h2>

  <h3>William Funn, III</h3>

  <p>How can you not have fun with this guy? Willy is an expert in intra-city travel, and a master at railway navigation, bus rides, and boats.  </p>

  <h3>Charlie "Goose" Guster</h3>

  <p>Goose used to be in the air force, having served in the war in Iraq. Now, he is our best plain expert. He can book almost any flight with whatever airway and will do his best to provide you with the best plane to your destination. </p>

  <h3>Marsha Kishter</h3>

  <p>Marsha is our connection in London. She helps to research hotels and sights in England. She's also one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet, and makes for a great co-worker.</p>

  <h3>Daryl Mayman</h3>

  <p>Daryl is a childhood friend of our lead accountant and writer. He helped to find credit card deals to make this whole website possible. </p>

  <h3>Jeff Spansail</h3>

  <p>Jeff is our lead and a huge travel enthusiast. He crunched the numbers to determine how to use miles on a trip to Europe. Having been to Europe 8 times, his method of travel has seen a lot of use. He hoped to contribute to the site to share what he had discovered.</p>

  <h3>Michael "Chicago" Jones</h3>

  <p>While earning his associate degree, he met another team member and joined our crew. All this European travel was new to him when he started. Like many people, he thought this was unaffordable. His title is research specialist. Next year he plans to visit Venice, London, and a few places in between.</p>
