<blockquote>
  
<p>Q: &nbsp;Who can go on their own like you do?</p>


<p>A: &nbsp;This type of travel is not for everyone. We do a lot of planning ahead of time. We also 			carry our own suitcases (pilot cases), so you have to be fit. We have a daily plan, and we 			don't always follow it, but it is better than not having one. You see in Europe people 			standing in lines for hours for some sites. We don't do that. We make reservations, get 			passes, and avoid the most crowded times.</p>

<p>Q:	 &nbsp;I heard you don't check luggage at all, is that true?</p>

<p>A:	 &nbsp;Yes, because we need to carry our luggage we don't take a lot. We take one week's 			worth of clothes and wash halfway through the 2-week trip.</p>

<p>Q:	 &nbsp;What do you say about people that want to be spontaneous?</p>

<p>A: 	 &nbsp;Those are the people that end up waiting in line most often; their indecisiveness is			costing them so often a train that they could have taken for 2 hours direct winds up 			taking then 6 hours or more. I want to spend my time seeing sights and not doing	 		research when I am there. My travel plans are flexible and there is some downtime and 			slack, but my planning research is done in the winter, so I can enjoy my time there. </p>

<p>Q:	 &nbsp;When I shop at a certain retailer, I was offered a credit card that gives me 5% off every purchase. Is 			that a good deal?</p>

<p>A: &nbsp;	If you spend $1,000 at that retailer every year, you will save $50 a year. You will need at least 20 			years to match the money that you will save with these reward point credit cards. Each 			new credit card requires a credit inquiry. Limit your inquiries and make sure you can see 			a big upside to getting a new credit card. All the cards mentioned here could save you 			over $800 on your next trip.	</p>

  <p>Q:	 &nbsp;I don't like paying annual fees for credit cards!</p>

  <p>A:	 &nbsp;Even after the annual fees, you are saving <strong>$6,595</strong> on you next trip. Do you know a 			better way? Let me know. </p>
