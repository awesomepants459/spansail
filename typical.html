<h1 id= "MainPageHeader"><strong>&nbsp; Typical Tour</strong></h1>


  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><blockquote>Looking at a typical email that I get from a tour operator, a 7-day tour of London and Paris costs $1,499 and <strong>includes airfare</strong>. That would be great. Where do I click and reserve? Or perhaps I should look into the details.</p>

    <p>Looking at the itinerary, I see a lot of free time. For this tour (and typically in many tours) I see 4 totally free days and 3 half days on your own. The whole point of the trip is to see the sites, and I want to do a bit more than just take a morning sightseeing excursion every few days. The tour offers additional excursions costing from $70 for a two-hour jaunt to a whole day outing costing $130. Since this tour has 3 half-days free and 4 full days free, I would easily estimate spending an additional $50 on the half days and $100 on the full days.  </p>

    <p>Also, when I take a closer look, I need to add $100 to that amount because I would depart from Chicago and not New York. </p>
  

    <p>So now let's see how these additional expenses just increased the cost of our trip.</p>

    <ul>

<table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Price of advertised Tour
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1,499</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Additional excursions Full days (4 x $75)
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Additional excursions half days (3 x $50)	</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150</td>
          
        

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Additional fee (travel from Chicago)</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100</td>
          
        </tr>

 

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><strong>Total </strong></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$2,049</strong></td>
          
        </tr>
      </table>

      
    </ul>

    <p>Now here's the bad news: This price is for travel in <strong>February.</strong> Unfortunately, I have something that gets in the way of that time frame: <strong>School.</strong>  And even if I had a break from school, I don't think walking around with my parka In Europe would be very enjoyable.</p>

    <p>There are tours during summer, but they cost more, and we are already at $2,049 for <strong>one person, for one week in February. </strong>   </p>
