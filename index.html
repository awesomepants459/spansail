<strong>Our Mission: Demonstrate how 2 people can tour Europe for 2 weeks for less than $2,000 during the summer.</strong> </p>

<ul>

<li>14 complete days with tons of sightseeing</li>
<li>Stay at some excellent and scenic hotels</li>
<li>No middle-of-nowhere creepy motels or cheap dinners</li>

</ul>
  <p><strong>Our secret sauce is using reward points from 4 credit cards to offset a major portion of the travel expense.</strong></p>

  <p>Five years ago, I took my first European trip, and it was nothing short of amazing. The awesome food at the Hofbräuhaus in Munch, the canal ride in Amsterdam and seeing Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin are experiences I can't wait to return to. I get daily emails from typical European tour operators, and they seem like a great deal at first. However, I did the math and calculated that when you add all the additional expenses, you're looking at a huge pivot from the advertized teaser price (see typical tour tab).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, a fellow travel enthusiast using reward points from credit cards, crunched the numbers and showed me how <strong>2 people can tour Europe for 2 weeks for less than $2,000 during the summer.</strong> I have to admit, at first, I was doubtful: </p>
  
<ul>
<li>The airfare alone is around $1,200 per person</li>
<li>I'm not sleeping in a tent or flying in the cargo hold</li>

  
</ul>



      <p>I looked at his numbers and it <strong>does add up</strong>. The next few pages will detail an itinerary, introduce the credit cards and show how they profoundly reduce our travel expenses.</p>

      <p>Our sample 2-week Itinerary and budget includes these 5 European regions: (see itinerary tab)</p>

      <ul>
<li>London (5 nights)</li>
<li>Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam (1 night)</li>
<li>Berlin (5 nights)</li>
<li>Munich (5 nights)</li>
<li>Zurich (1 night)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We hope to show an alternative trip that will include Italy and Switzerland in the future. For now, let’s roll with this itinerary.</p>

   <p><strong>We plan it out ourselves; good guidebooks and the internet make it all possible. </strong></p>   

  <p>Using the rewards from 4 credit cards offers makes this possible. At the time of this writing (8/20/2023), these offers were available. Different bonuses may be currently offered.</p>

      <ul>
<li>Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (current offer is for 60k points as of 8/20/2024)</li>
<li>Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card (still offered as of 8/20/2024)</li>
<li>Platinum American Express (still offered as of 8/20/2024)</li>
<li>Capital One Venture (still offered as of 8/20/2024)</li>
        

        
      </ul>


      <p>The next few pages show a budget for each of the 4 major expenses for our trip along with how the credit card rewards slash the price tag.</p>

      <ul>
<li>Flight</li>
<li>Hotel</li>
<li>Sightseeing and transport within each city</li>
<li>Transport from one European city to another</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="sectionHeader">Flight</h2>



      <p>Let's dive right in and see how we're going to offset the international flight that costs around $1,200 per ticket during summer.</p>

      <p>Currently, United Airlines requires 75,000 – 80,000 miles for a round-trip flight to Europe. Flying into London (from Chicago) will cost 35,000 – 40,000 Miles in May/June plus $5.60. Flying back to Chicago from Zurich in May /June will cost 32,000-40,000 miles plus $35 as of 8/20/24. The Sapphire Preferred Credit card is offering 60K bonus points (which can be converted into 60K miles) when you spend $4K in the first three months of getting the card. This card has a bunch of other incentives, but for now let's focus on the points. You get 3 points per dollar when you spend at restaurants and 1 point per dollar elsewhere. Needing around 150,000 miles for 2 people (75K x 2), this credit card gets you part of the way there (64K points, 60,000 bonus + 4,000 for spending). So, what will you do to get the other 100K needed? You have a few options. First, there is a referral bonus with the card, currently (8/20/2024) 10K. Second, you can join Mileage Plus Dining, register your Sapphire credit card and earn miles. Let's see how you can eat your way to Europe.  </p>

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>8 total miles per dollar x $95 per week x 50 weeks (5 miles per dollar as a Dining VIP member plus earn 3
 points per dollar for using your Sapphire Card)
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38,000</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>First Dine Bonus</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500</td>
          
        </tr>

        

        
      </table>


      <p> Third, you can go to Mileage Plus Shopping and earn miles. Let's drill down on that.</p>

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Approx. 4 miles per dollar x $100 per week x 50 weeks (Earnings vary by merchant, approx. 3 miles per dollar
 thru Mileage Plus Shopping plus earn 1 point per dollar
 for using your Sapphire Card)

</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,000</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Approximate bonus (1,000 miles per month)			   

</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,000</td>
          
        </tr>

        

        
      </table>

<p>Fourth, remember that it is very important that you get your 60,000-point spending bonus. I suggest you use the card for other expenses besides Mileage Plus Dining and Shopping.</p>


<table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>$1,000 per month for 12 months
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;12,000</td>
          
        </tr>

        

        
      </table>

<p>Adding up all these points you earn with your new Chase Sapphire Credit Card will get you the miles needed for your 2 award tickets to Europe.</p>


<table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Bonus for meeting spending requirement
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60,000</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Referral Bonus
</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Mileage Plus Dining (38,000+500)</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38,500</td>
          
        

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Mileage Plus Shopping (20,000 + 12,000)</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32,000</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><li>Spending on items (besides dining and shopping) </li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,000</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><strong>Total </strong></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>152,500</strong></td>
          
        </tr>
      </table>

<p>You can also buy those additional needed miles if going to the restaurants and the referral bonus is not how you roll. Keep in mind that you must spend $4,000 in 90 days to get the big bonus, (60,000 points) That wasn't too bad: you now have two international tickets to Europe. I think that justifies paying the $95 credit card annual fee! You just saved about $2,400 on airfare.  </p>



<p>My CPA friend, who helped me crunch these numbers, has flown 9 times to Europe on award tickets and has always found seats available (book early). There are taxes and surcharges that you will have to pay on your award travel. On his last trip, he paid $5.60 for his flight to Europe (London) and $35 for the return (Zurich). Therefore, in my budget I will plan to spend $81.20 for 2 people (total) for taxes in addition to the $95 credit card annual fee. (total airfare expense $81.20 +$95 = $176.20)</p>


<h2 class="sectionHeader">Hotels</h2>

<p>This itinerary includes 17 nights in a hotel:</p>
      
<ul>
<li>5 nights in London</li>
<li>1 night in Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam</li>
<li>5 nights in Berlin</li>
<li>5 nights in Munich</li>
<li>1 night in Zurich</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card gives one free night (when you spend 15K in a calendar year) plus 150K bonus points when you spend 3K in the first 6 months (A while ago I saw an opportunity to get an additional 30K in points when you spent an additional 8K in the first 6 months).  </p>

<p>You will also get 6 points per dollar spent on restaurants, gas and supermarkets, and 3 points per dollar spent everywhere else. </p>
      
<p>Let's do a sample calculation to see what we could have earned and hopefully an even better offer comes along. Let's forecast using this card for groceries ($125 per week), and gas ($75 per week).  </p>




<table border="1">

  <tr>
<td colspan="2"><li>6 points per $ for groceries and gas ($200 per week x 52)</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62,400</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
  <td colspan="2"><li>3 points per $ for other items ($100 per week x 52)</li></td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,600</td>

          </tr>

    <tr>
<td colspan="2"><li>Bonus for meeting 3K spending requirement</li></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150,000</td>
          
        </tr>

  <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><strong>Total </strong></td>
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>228,000</strong></td>
          
        </tr>


</table>


<p>Keep in mind, this is the offer that I see at 8/20/2023. There could be better offers in the future.</p>

<p>The card also 2 important additional features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Executive Floor Lounge Access (complimentary snacks and drinks) <strong>when available</strong></li>
<li>Complimentary Gold status: Free Breakfast, 5th night awarded free</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s look at the American Express Platinum Card. This Card is offering 175,000 bonus points when you spend $8,000 in the first 6 months of getting the card. You get one point per dollar spent.</p>

<p>Let's do a sample calculation to see what we could earn. </p>

      <table border="1">

        <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><li>1 point per $ ($8,000 required amt to get bonux)</li></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,000</td>

              </tr>

          <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><li>Bonus for meeting 8K spending requirement</li></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175,000</td>

              </tr>

        <tr>
                <td colspan="2"><strong>Total </strong></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>183,000</strong></td>

              </tr>


      </table>

<p>Now those American Express points need to be converted to Hilton Honors Points. Currently 1 Amex Point = 2 Hilton Honors points, but very often they have specials where 1 Amex Point = 2.8 Honors Points.</p>

<p>Converting your 183,000 Amex Points get you 512,400 Hilton Honors Points (183,000 x 2.8)</p>

<p>Adding your Hilton points from both credit cards:</p>

      <table border="1">

        <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><li>Hilton Surpass Credit Card</li></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;228,000</td>

              </tr>

          <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><li>Bonus for meeting 8K spending requirement</li></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;512,400</td>

              </tr>

        <tr>
                <td colspan="2"><strong>Total </strong></td>
                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>740,400</strong></td>

              </tr>


      </table>
      

<p>Now let’s see how we can put these points to good use to offset our hotel expenses. Looking at Hilton Honors website, I see there are many Hilton hotels in London that you can stay at during May/June for 60,000 per night. Remember, I am booking these rooms several (4-6) months in advance. In London, I particularly like the Westminster Curio because of its central location. I plan to stay there during our next trip. Last year in Berlin, we stayed at the Hilton (on Mohrenstrasse) and it was wonderful. In May/June 2025, rooms are going for around 60,000 points. In Munich, rooms go for 60,000 per night as well. Keep in mind that these rooms normally cost $200-$350 without breakfast. Because you will be a Hilton Gold Member you will have breakfast included. Some Hilton properties like the Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn will give free breakfast for all guests, but other Hilton Properties will only include breakfast for gold level (and above) members. Also, the free breakfast varies according to each hotel.  Some hotels offer continental breakfast, some have a full breakfast, others offer dining credit. Always check with the hotel. The Hiton Honors Gold level makes you eligible for an upgrade if available. They may also upgrade you to a club level room where you will have access to a lounge with free drinks and desserts. Last, as a gold member you get the fifth night free on a five-night stay.</p>

<p>Let’s see where we stand so far with the points that you earned with your Platinum Amex and Hilton Surpass Credit Cards. Remember you earned 740,400 points calculated above plus one free night.</p>
  
      <table border="1">

        <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><li>5 nights in London using points (60,000 points x 4, fifth night free)</li></td>

      </table>

      <p>How about that, you just happen to have all the points needed!</p>

      <p>Looking at an average price for these hotels ($300 per night), 17 nights would cost you $4,800.  Compare that to the annual fee that you paid for those two credit cards. </p>

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Sightseeing & Local Transport</h2>

<p>Most European cities have sightseeing passes. The pass price is determined by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of days to be used</li>
  <li>Free entry vs. discounted entry to sights</li>
  <li>Travel within the city: included or not</li>
</ul>

<p>A good example is the Berlin Welcome Card and the Berlin Welcome Card all-inclusive. The Welcome Card provides city transport plus 25-50% off sites. The all-inclusive Welcome Card Includes city transport, free admission to 30 activities, plus 25-50% off other sites. Below is the price for the Berlin Welcome Card:</p>

<p>However, we did not factor in our last credit card, the Capital One Venture Card. That card offers 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months of getting the card. You also earn 2 miles per dollar charged on the card. These miles work a bit differently than the Chase Sapphire Miles mentioned earlier. With the above-mentioned Chase Sapphire Credit Card, you earn points which you can convert to Mileage Plus miles. When you have 60K Mileage Plus miles you can fly on an award ticket to Europe (roundtrip). The Capital One Venture credit card is used another way. The miles that you earn are used to offset costs for travel-related expenses. You can use them to offset an airline ticket purchased. For example, if your airfare costs $600, you would need 60K Capital One miles (the rate is 1 cent per mile). Because I like to travel in the summer and tickets cost around $1,200 during that time, I would need 120K Capital One miles to offset this expense for each ticket. Therefore, I will use my Chase Sapphire to offset my flight expenses and use my capital one to offset my sightseeing and local travel expenses.</p>

<p>Your Capital one Venture Credit Card has one more exciting benefit worth mentioning. That is, in addition to the 75,000 bonus miles you will also receive $250.00 in Travel Credit. That can be used for airfare, hotels and car Rentals. Since we already have our airfare covered and we will not be using car rentals, let’s use this amount to book one night’s stay in Zurich Switzerland. Now our 16 days night vacation just got extended to 17 days with no extra expense.</p>

<p><strong>Two people can go to Europe for 2 weeks for less than $2,000</strong>. This is just one example. Let me give a couple of reminders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I did not even mention some of the additional bonuses you get for having the Capital One Venture credit card like the Priority Pass Lounge tickets and Global Entry or TSA Pre-check credit. Also, the Hilton Surpass Credit Card gives you $200 credit on your hotels. ($50 per quarter) </li>
  <li>Getting the bonus on these credit cards is key. If you need to spend $4,000 in 3 months and only spend $3,800 you do not get the bonus. There is no consolation prize.</li>
  <li>Book your travel in advance. The expense that I used for my examples (especially trains) is based on booking a few months in advance at least.</li>
<li>Credit card offers vary and when a good bonus comes along, you need to be ready. Take a look and do a little research to see what offers have been made in the past.</li>
<li>One or two new credit inquiries per year should not hurt your credit score. Space your new credit cards out so that you have time to achieve the spend requirement to get your bonus.</li>
<li>Some sights are very crowded. Read your guidebooks so you know how to skip the line in many cases by buying your city attraction pass or reserve a time slot if possible. </li>
<li>One or two new credit inquiries per year should not hurt your credit score. Space your new credit cards out so that you have time to achieve the spend requirement to get your bonus.</li>
<li>Some sights are very crowded. Read you guidebooks so you know how to skip the line in many cases by buying you city attraction pass or reserve a time slot if possible. </li>
<li>You will need to plan things out yourself. Of course, your tour will be custom and personalized but that also means you will need to do the work.</li>
<li>You must have good credit to take advantage of credit card bonus offers.</li>
<li>Be able to strategize using your points. Take advantage of all your credit card perks.</li>
<li>Navigate public transportation.</li>
<li>Make a daily itinerary. Know what you are going to see and how you are going to get there. </li>
<li>•	Let me say this again: this style of travel is not for everyone. Some people just want to go to Europe for a week and see what the tour shows them. <strong>On my trip I see all the sights I want to see, and I can do it during the summer. 2 People, 2 weeks, $2,000.</strong>  </li>
<li>Send me an email about your epic journey!</li>
