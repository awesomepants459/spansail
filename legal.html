  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><blockquote>We do not guarantee what you will spend. We only make estimates.</p>


    <p>Past performance is no guarantee of future offerings.</p>

    <p>Read all credit card agreements, consult with your financial advisor.</p>

    <p>The points and miles offered change frequently.  Redeeming points is never guaranteed.</p>

    <p>We hope that you use this as one of many tools to put together an epic trip.</p>

    <p>Book early and do your own research. See the sights that you want to see.</p>

    <p>This method of travel is not for everyone. It does work for us.</p>

    <p>You must be able to pay the balance off in full each month for this to work. If you have balances	on other cards that are charging you high amounts of interest, perhaps now is not the time to 	take a European vacation.</p>

    <p>You must have very good credit to get these credit cards. Pay them off by the due date.</p>
